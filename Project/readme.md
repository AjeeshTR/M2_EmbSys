Overview of my Repository:
# SMART VACUUM CLEANER 
## Description:
We live in a period in which the automation had taken place a vital role and through which the process of implementing the new things through robotic and automation have developed in a better and Efficient ways.This makes me an motivation to come up with an Effective way of developing an SMART VACUUM CLEANER Which was done under various Technique which involves Sensors, Actuators, Microcontrollers and so on.

## APPLICATIONS
* Capture Excess Pet Hair 
* Exert Insect Control
* Freshen Upholstery, Pillows, and Carpets
* Prevent House Fires
* Reduce Indoor Allergens
* Recover Small Items
* Trap Dust Before It Spreads

## Conclusions

Through the use of an Arduino Board with more electrical functionality, a cheaper and user-friendly Vacuum Cleaner device could be constructed with two separate modes of control (Manual and Autonomous mode). This project's future goals include battery monitoring, self-charging, a reduced body weight, and the ability to manually set alarm on/off times.
