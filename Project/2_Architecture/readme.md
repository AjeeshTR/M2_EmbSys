# Proposed Block Diagram
This Block diagram stating with different marketly available sensors used for our Project and hence User-Friendly.

# Proposed Flow Chart
An Proposed Flow chart developed in such a way that our project would be understood in an easier way.

# Simulide Software
Thus our Ultimate Goal to develop an Simulation done with higher level implementation and hence provided with an design of our Project which includes Ultrasonic Sensors, Relays - acts as an Actuators, Motor and respective drivers, Microcontroller and an LCD display
